# ABOUT ME

Hello, I’m **Nrishinghananda Roy**, a self-taught developer driven by resilience, curiosity, and an unwavering commitment to mastering my craft. My journey into tech was far from traditional. Growing up in a rural village in India, with financial hardships and limited resources, I faced an uphill battle from an early age. Navigating a life with limited support, I learned the value of perseverance and self-reliance.

Without access to formal university education, I took my future into my own hands. I taught myself programming, not out of convenience, but necessity. Along the way, I discovered Rust, a language that immediately resonated with me. Rust’s emphasis on safety, performance, and reliability captivated me, and I knew I’d found my path. Today, I’m deeply committed to Rust, backend development, and building efficient, secure, and high-performance systems. Rust isn’t just a skill for me; it’s a craft I’m constantly honing and applying in innovative ways.

I’m passionate about contributing to the open-source community. It’s an environment where I can both share my work and learn from others, and I believe deeply in the power of collaborative knowledge and growth. Though I’m relatively new to open-source, I’m eager to contribute and become a more active member in Rust and backend projects.

Despite the challenges, I’ve developed a foundation in backend development, particularly with Rust, and am comfortable with frontend and infrastructure work. My goal is to bring my skills to a team that values resilience, dedication, and the desire to innovate in a fast-evolving tech landscape.

Thank you for taking the time to learn about my journey. I’m excited to connect with like-minded professionals, continue learning, and contribute to projects that drive meaningful impact in tech.
