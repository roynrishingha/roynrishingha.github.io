# ABOUT ME

Hi, I’m **Nrishinghananda Roy**, a self-taught developer with a deep passion for coding and an insatiable curiosity for technology. My journey began in the heart of India, where traditions and innovation blend seamlessly. Growing up, I found myself fascinated by the endless possibilities of science and technology, but financial circumstances led me down a unique path: I became my own teacher, diving into the world of programming without formal education.

Throughout this journey, I developed a strong connection with Rust, a language that feels as natural to me as breathing. Rust’s power, performance, and safety have inspired me to dig deeper into the realms of API development and DevOps. The cloud-native world, with its potential to shape data and create efficient solutions, continues to fuel my desire to innovate.

My passion for technology also extends to the open-source community, a place where collaboration and shared learning thrive. Though I'm relatively new to the community, I'm excited to contribute, learn from experts, and grow alongside others who share a love for open-source. It’s my way of giving back, creating positive change, and learning from the collective wisdom of those around me.

I’m grateful to mentors and fellow developers who’ve offered guidance along the way. Their support has been invaluable, and I’m excited to keep growing, exploring new frontiers in technology, and building meaningful solutions.

Thank you for taking the time to learn a bit about me. I look forward to connecting, learning, and collaborating as we explore the endless possibilities in tech together!
