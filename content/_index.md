I’m Nrishinghananda Roy — a software engineer with 3 years of experience building backend systems in Rust at early-stage startups. I have been working in small teams where engineers are expected to solve real problems quickly and independently — whether that means optimizing APIs, rewriting slow services, or shipping infrastructure that doesn’t break under traffic.

Over time, I’ve grown more interested in what powers software at a deeper level. I’ve started contributing to open-source WebAssembly runtimes and studying the internals of Cranelift and Wasmtime to understand how these systems work under the hood. It’s slow and technical, but I enjoy the process of reading real code and learning from it.

Right now I’m looking for a remote role on a small team working on runtimes, compiler infrastructure, or developer tooling. I want to build alongside engineers who care about clarity, correctness, and thoughtful engineering. If that sounds like you — I’d love to hear from you: [roynrishingha@gmail.com](mailto:roynrishingha@gmail.com)
