I'm Nrishinghananda Roy—a self-taught backend engineer with a deep commitment to building robust, high-performance systems in Rust. My path into software wasn’t conventional. I grew up in rural India, where access to resources, mentorship, or formal education was limited. I taught myself programming and built my career through hands-on work, real-world results, and relentless curiosity.
I became captivated by the elegance of code—how logic, structure, and performance come together to solve real problems. Rust in particular drew me in. Its precision, safety, and philosophy of correctness resonated deeply with how I think and build. It’s more than a tool—it’s the craft I’m committed to mastering.

Over the last two years, I’ve worked with fast-moving startups as a core backend developer. I’ve designed scalable APIs in Rust (using Actix and Axum), contributed to production infrastructure on AWS and GCP, and delivered full-stack features using React and TypeScript. I’ve also migrated Python pipelines to Rust, significantly improving performance and reducing technical debt.

While Rust is my core focus, I’ve hands-on experience across the stack and DevOps layers. I learn quickly, often independently, driven by a deep desire to understand how things work and how to make them better.
I don’t hold a formal degree. What I do hold is a proven track record of learning fast, delivering reliably, and staying committed to technical excellence. I’ve been the sole breadwinner for my family, and this responsibility has made me dependable, focused, and outcome-driven.

I’m actively looking for a remote role with a startup that values practical skill, clean code, and real ownership. I’m also an active open source contributor in the Rust ecosystem, and I’m eager to grow alongside teams that care about quality and purpose.
If you’re building something meaningful and want a developer who’s lived through real challenges, found his passion through them, and knows how to deliver—[let’s talk](mailto:roynrishingha@gmail.com).
