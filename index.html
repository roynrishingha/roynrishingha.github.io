		Hello there! My name is Nrishinghananda Roy, an ambitious software engineer hailing from the vibrant land of
		India.
		Overcoming hurdles and embracing self-learning, I have charted a unique path in the realm of technology. This
		personal
		journey has honed my skills in DevOps, open-source contributions, Rust programming, and API development. As I
		delve into
		the fascinating field of database development, I envision a future that
		merges my
		passion for database systems, API development, and a solid foundation in DevOps.
	</p>
	<p>
		This brief glimpse into my life will provide you with a comprehensive understanding of my experiences,
		expertise, and
		aspirations.
	</p>

	<p>
		I was born and raised in India, a country teeming with rich culture and diverse opportunities. From a young age,
		I
		exhibited a strong curiosity and fascination with technology. However, my path to becoming a software engineer
		was not a
		conventional one. Due to financial constraints, I had to make the difficult decision to drop out of formal
		education,
		leaving me without an engineering degree.
	</p>
	<p>
		Undeterred by this setback, I embarked on a journey of self-learning, leveraging my determination, resilience,
		and
		unyielding passion for coding. Equipped with unwavering dedication, I began my pursuit of knowledge, immersing
		myself in
		a myriad of online resources, coding tutorials, and open-source communities. This period of independent study
		allowed me
		to forge my own path, acquire invaluable skills, and ultimately shape my destiny as a software engineer.
	</p>
	<p>
		After years of self-study and relentless practice, I ventured into the world of freelancing. This phase not only
		allowed
		me to apply my coding skills but also provided valuable exposure to diverse projects and clients. The challenges
		I
		encountered during this period honed my problem-solving abilities, strengthened my communication skills, and
		deepened my
		understanding of software development lifecycles.
	</p>
	<p>Currently, I am employed as a Software Engineer, specializing in the dynamic field of DevOps. My role entails
		harnessing
		various tools and technologies such as GCP, Docker, Github Actions, Terraform, Ansible, Nginx, and
		Golang streamline and automate development processes. This position has provided me with invaluable insights
		into
		building scalable and efficient infrastructures while emphasizing the importance of collaboration, continuous
		integration, and continuous deployment.
	</p>
	<p>
		Beyond my professional endeavors, I have actively engaged in open-source projects, an integral part of the
		software
		development community. One of my key areas of expertise lies in Rust programming, a powerful and safe systems
		programming language. I have dedicated considerable time and effort to contribute to Rust projects, including
		the highly
		regarded Rust Clippy. Through these contributions, I have enhanced my understanding of Rust's nuances, best
		practices,
		and idiomatic expressions, solidifying my position as a skilled Rust developer.
	</p>
	<p>
		As I embark on the next phase of my career, I am delving into the fascinating realm of database development.
		This domain captivate me due to it's fundamental nature of could-native development. With a keen interest in
		database systems, I aim to leverage my existing skill set in DevOps
		and API
		development to craft innovative solutions that empower businesses to harness the power of data effectively.
	</p>
	<p>
		I am eager to explore opportunities where I can apply my expertise in database systems, API development, and
		DevOps
		fundamentals. Whether it be joining a forward-thinking organization or taking on short-term contracts, I am open
		to new
		challenges that enable me to contribute meaningfully and continue my professional growth.
