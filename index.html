      <p>Hi üëã I'm Nrishinghananda Roy.</p>

      <p>
        For the past few years, I've been building backend systems at early-stage startups ‚Äî mostly using Rust ü¶Ä,
        sometimes
        Python and TypeScript. I've worked in small teams where the problems don't come pre-packaged or neatly scoped.
        You
        figure it out, you ship it, and if it breaks under pressure, it's on you to fix it. That kind of environment
        shaped how
        I think: you learn fast, you take responsibility, and you build things that won't fall apart at 2 a.m.
      </p>

      <p>
        I've always been drawn to the quieter parts of engineering ‚Äî the layers that most people don't see but that
        everything
        else depends on. Not flashy features or pixel-perfect UIs, but the systems behind the scenes: infrastructure,
        runtimes,
        observability, performance bottlenecks. I care about how things work ‚Äî deeply, internally, at the level where
        correctness and clarity really matter.
      </p>

      <p>
        Over time, I've found myself diving deeper into the Rust ecosystem ‚Äî contributing to tools like Clippy,
        exploring
        production-grade open source projects, and learning how large-scale systems are built with precision and care.
        It's not
        easy work, but it's the kind of work that holds up. And that's what I'm here for ‚Äî engineering that lasts.
      </p>

      <p>
        Right now, I'm focused on backend systems written in Rust ‚Äî especially projects that build infrastructure for
        developers. I'm contributing to open-source projects, leveling up my skills, and learning how to solve problems.
        What
        drives me is the pursuit of mastery, not just ‚Äúmore experience‚Äù but deeper experience ‚Äî the kind you earn by
        putting in
        the reps on real systems that serve real users.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm not here to chase trends. I'm here to build things that work, with people who take their craft seriously. If
        that's
        you too, I'd love to connect: <a href="mailto:roynrishingha@gmail.com">roynrishingha@gmail.com</a>
